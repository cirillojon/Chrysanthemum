# Manual QA Checklist

Automated checks (lint, typecheck, 261 unit + contract tests, build) run in CI on every push.
This checklist covers behaviour that requires a real browser + live Supabase.

Run this before merging any release branch into `main`.

## A. Coins on Harvest

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| A1 | Harvest any flower manually (tap a bloomed plot) | Coin balance **does not change** |
| A2 | Harvest a **mutated** bloom (Golden, Frozen, etc.) manually | Coin balance still **does not change** |
| A3 | Sell that mutated bloom from the Inventory tab | Coins **do** increase by `sellValue × multiplier` |
| A4 | DevTools → Network → `harvest` edge function response | Body contains `ok: true`, **no** `bonusCoins`, **no** `coins` field |
| A5 | Supabase Table Editor → `game_saves` → watch `coins` column during a harvest | Column value **does not change** on harvest, only on sell |

## B. Harvest Bell — Off-Tab Popup

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| B1 | Place a Harvest Bell. Navigate to **Inventory** tab. Wait for a plant to bloom and be in range. | Harvest popup appears **on the Inventory tab** |
| B2 | Same setup, navigate to **Shop** tab | Popup appears on Shop tab |
| B3 | Same setup, navigate to **Social** tab | Popup appears on Social tab |
| B4 | Navigate back to Garden after the popup appeared off-tab | Garden grid correctly shows the plant is gone |
| B5 | Check Inventory tab | Bloom was added to inventory correctly |

---

## C. Harvest Bell — Continues Running Off-Tab

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| C1 | Set up a bell + bloomed plant. Navigate away from Garden. Wait 2–3 min. Return. | Bell harvested plants while off-tab; grid is cleared; inventory has blooms |
| C2 | DevTools → Network while on a non-garden tab | `harvest` edge calls fire even when Garden tab is not visible |
| C3 | Watch the **Blooms** badge on the Inventory tab icon | Badge increments when the bell fires off-tab |

---

## D. Auto-Planter — Continues Running Off-Tab

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| D1 | Set up an auto-planter with seeds in inventory. Navigate away. Wait 30 s. Return. | Plants were planted while off-tab; seed count in inventory decreased |
| D2 | Trigger a cron race (plant manually while planter is active) | No repeated `plant-seed` calls for already-occupied cells (check DevTools Network) |

---

## E. Profile Page — Real-Time Updates

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| E1 | Open your own profile (Social → Me) with a harvest bell and plants | Bell harvests and profile garden updates live every ~5 s without a page reload |
| E2 | From a **second account**, open the first account's profile | Profile updates when the first account's cron ticks (~30 s) |
| E3 | Watch a plant transition seed → sprout → bloom on the other account's profile | Stage advances every ~5 s between cron ticks (client-side simulation) |
| E4 | Bell harvest visible from second account | Profile shows the plot clearing after cron tick |

---

## F. Tab Switching / Mount Stability

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| F1 | Rapidly switch between all tabs | No crashes, no white screen, no stuck loading |
| F2 | Plant a seed on Garden tab, switch to Shop, return | Plant is still there with correct growth state |
| F3 | Open Seed Picker on Garden tab, switch tabs | Picker closes; app does not hang |
| F4 | Swipe between tabs while a harvest popup is showing | Popup persists across the swipe and auto-dismisses |

---

## G. Server Integrity (Supabase)

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| G1 | `action_log` rows for `harvest` actions | `result` column contains `{ ok: true }`, **no** `bonusCoins` or `newCoins` |
| G2 | `game_saves.coins` across a full session | Only changes on sell/buy, never on harvest |
| G3 | Place gear while a cron tick is in flight | Placement succeeds (CAS retry handles the race); gear appears in grid |
