## [v2.1.4] — 2026-04-27 — Gifting Fixes

### Fixed
- **Coins awarded on gift** — gifting a flower no longer runs the sell logic; the item is removed from inventory with no coin change
- **Gift duplication on reload** — send-gift edge function now atomically deducts the item from the sender's DB inventory and inserts the gift row in a single server call; a page reload between steps can no longer leave the item in both places
- **Can gift a listed item** — server validates the item exists in the sender's DB inventory before the gift is created, closing the stale-client-state loophole
- **Gifted flowers blocked from Botany** — claim-gift edge function now writes the flower directly to the receiver's DB inventory; it's available for Botany immediately without waiting for an auto-save
- **Mutation emoji missing on friend cards** — friend profile flowers in the Social → Friends tab now show the mutation emoji overlay, matching the leaderboard

---

## [v2.1.3] — 2026-04-27 — Marketplace & Garden

### Added
- **🌱 Seeds in Marketplace** — seed items can now be listed and purchased; seed listings display the seed emoji and a "Seed" label to distinguish them from blooms
- **⚡ Real-time listing sync** — new listings appear instantly for all browsers; sold or cancelled listings disappear without a page refresh (Supabase Realtime Postgres Changes)
- **🗑 Remove planted flower** — tap any growing (non-bloomed) plant to open its tooltip and remove it; the seed is returned to your inventory. Bloomed plants must still be harvested
- **Tooltip viewport clamping** — plot tooltip no longer clips off the left or right screen edge on mobile; it measures its position before first paint and nudges itself into view

### Fixed
- **Marketplace race condition** — buying a listing that another player just purchased now shows a friendly "just sold" message and removes the phantom entry, rather than throwing an error

---

## [v2.1.2] — 2026-04-27 — Bug Fixes & UI

### Fixed
- **Shop "Flower not in stock" errors (final fix)** — if the post-restock server sync failed silently, the buy handler now auto-resyncs the shop and retries once before rolling back; no page refresh needed

### Changed
- **🏪 Marketplace moved into Social tab** — all player-to-player features (Search, Friends, Gifts, Ranks, Market, My Profile) are now under one tab; main nav reduced from 7 tabs to 6

---

## [v2.1.1] — 2026-04-27 — Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **Collect All inventory trickle** — harvested blooms now appear in inventory all at once instead of one by one; each server response was overwriting the optimistic inventory with the DB's partial state
- **Harvest rollback now undoes inventory** — a failed harvest correctly removes the flower that was optimistically added, rather than leaving a ghost item
- **Shop "Flower not in stock" errors** — shop restock sync is now queued before any buy, eliminating the race where a buy fired before the new shop was written to the server
- **Stale fertilizer multipliers in harvest function** — server-side bloom check now uses the correct multipliers (Basic 1.1×, Advanced 1.25×, Premium 1.5×, Elite 1.75×, Miracle 2×)

---

## [v2.1.0] — 2026-04-27 — Marketplace

### Added
- **🏪 Marketplace** — buy and sell harvested flowers with other players; all active listings are visible to everyone
- **Listing slots** — start with 0 slots; unlock first slot for 10,000 coins, then 50k → 150k → 350k → 650k, max 5 slots
- **5% listing fee** — charged upfront when creating a listing; non-refundable regardless of outcome
- **48-hour expiry** — unsold listings expire automatically and the flower is returned to your inventory (hourly GitHub Actions sweep)
- **Price history chart** — expand any listing to see a Recharts line chart of the last 30 sale prices with a dashed base-sell-value reference line
- **My Listings tab** — view active listings with expiry countdown, cancel to reclaim the item, and browse sold/expired history
- **Browse filters** — search by flower name, filter by rarity, sort by newest / price ascending / price descending
- Seller credits are applied atomically via `add_coins_to_user` DB function; buyer save and seller credit run in parallel

### Fixed
- **Botany race condition (#61)** — simultaneous conversions no longer produce errors; perform calls are serialized so concurrent DB writes can't race each other
- **Forecast slots 5–8 showing "Pending" (#62)** — SQL forecast loop now generates enough entries to fill all 8 unlocked slots
- **Time-restricted weather outside allowed windows** — Golden Hour, Prismatic Skies, and Star Shower now gate correctly using Eastern Time on both client and server
- **`advance_weather` inserting NULL weather type** — rewrote `_pick_weather` SQL function with explicit per-type variables to eliminate the NULL constraint violation
- Forecast relative times now display as `Xh Xm` / `Xd Xh` for durations beyond 60 minutes / 24 hours
- Plot tooltip growth time now shows days/hours (e.g. `2d 6h`) when remaining time exceeds 24 hours

### Changed
- **Fertilizer rebalanced** — speed multipliers are now Basic 1.1×, Advanced 1.25×, Premium 1.5×, Elite 1.75×, Miracle 2×
- **Clear skies more common** — weight increased from 40 → 60

---

## [v2.0.3] — 2026-04-27 — UI Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- Claim Gift button text is now properly centered
- Codex rarity breakdown and filter now include Prismatic
- Codex rarity labels now show the full name instead of a 3-letter abbreviation

---

## [v2.0.2] — 2026-04-27 — Concurrency & Race Condition Fixes

### Fixed
- **Harvest race conditions** — rapid harvesting (individual clicks, "Collect All", or both simultaneously) no longer produces "No plant in this plot" errors or spurious rollbacks
  - All harvest server calls are serialized through a client-side queue so concurrent DB grid writes can never overwrite each other
  - `getState()` (backed by a synchronous ref) replaces stale render-closure `state` in all action handlers so each rapid click chains off the previous optimistic result
  - Surgical rollback on failure restores only the affected plot cell, leaving other concurrently-harvested plots intact
  - `harvestingPlots` ref blocks the seed picker from opening on plots whose harvest is still in-flight
  - `harvestingRef` per tile prevents double-clicking the same bloom tile
  - `harvestPending` prop lets each PlotTile check whether Collect All already queued it, preventing double-queue when both paths fire for the same plot
- **Sell race conditions** — rapidly clicking "Sell 1" or "Sell All" no longer produces "Item not in inventory" errors
  - `sellingRef` per inventory card blocks any sell while the current server call is in-flight
  - Sell handler reads live quantity from `getState()` instead of the stale render prop
  - Serialized sell queue prevents concurrent DB inventory writes from racing each other
- **Buy race conditions** — rapidly clicking "Buy" or "Buy All" in the shop no longer produces "Flower not in stock" / "Fertilizer not in stock" errors
  - `buyingRef` per shop card blocks any buy while the current server call is in-flight
  - Buy handlers read live shop quantity from `getState()` to short-circuit when stock is already depleted optimistically
  - Serialized buy queue prevents concurrent shop writes from racing
- **Harvest → plant race** — "Collect All" now awaits all queued harvests before "Plant All" fires, preventing plant-seed from racing a harvest that hasn't hit the DB yet
- **Collect All double-queue** — clicking "Collect All" while individual tile harvests are in-flight no longer double-queues the same plot
- **Idempotent harvest edge function** — server now returns 200 (no-op) when a plot is already empty instead of 400, stopping the rollback → re-queue cascade that previously multiplied errors
- **Idempotent sell edge function** — server now returns 200 (no-op) when an item is already sold/depleted instead of 400, for the same reason

---

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-04-26 — Edge Function Hotfix

### Fixed
- All game actions (plant, harvest, sell, buy, fertilize, upgrade) were returning 401 Unauthorized and rolling back — root cause was local JWT verification using `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, which is not automatically injected into Edge Functions
- Harvest failing server-side bloom check because `bloomedAt` is client-only and never written to the DB — fixed by computing bloom status server-side from `timePlanted` + growth catalog + fertilizer + mastery
- Shop sell values were completely stale for newer flowers (many returned 0 coins) — updated to match current full flower catalog
- `apply-fertilizer` rejecting `advanced` and `elite` fertilizer types — these were missing from the valid types list

### Changed
- All Edge Functions now use `auth.getUser()` for JWT verification (reliable, officially supported)
- JWT decode + DB load run in parallel via `Promise.all` — auth and save are fetched simultaneously to reduce latency
- All Edge Functions now use targeted column selects instead of `SELECT *` to reduce DB payload

---

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-04-26 — Server-Authoritative Architecture

### Added
- **🔒 Server-authoritative game logic** — all actions (plant, harvest, buy, sell, fertilize, upgrade, convert) are now validated and written server-side via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Optimistic UI with automatic rollback** — actions feel instant but revert silently if the server rejects them
- `marketplaceSlots` field on game saves (default 2) in preparation for v2.1.0 Marketplace
- Server-side audit log for all game actions

### Changed
- `game_saves` is now protected by Row Level Security — clients can only read their own save; all writes go through Edge Functions
- Removed client-side auto-save for signed-in users — Edge Functions own all writes

### Security
- Game state can no longer be manipulated via client-side localStorage or direct Supabase writes
- Coin calculations, inventory changes, and discoveries are all validated server-side

- **Mastery indicators** — ⚡ badge in the seed picker and yellow highlighted timer in the plot tooltip show when a mastery bonus is active

### Changed
- Shop now rolls rarity first (weighted: Common → Mythic), then picks a random flower from that tier — guaranteeing variety across all rarities
- Shop buy price changed from 60% → 75% of sell value
- Sell values rebalanced across all tiers — each tier now has at most a 2× spread from cheapest to most expensive, scaled by growth time

### Fixed
- Coral Bells renamed to Pearlwort with a working emoji (previous emoji was broken on older devices)

- Wet → Shocked upgrade now applies gradually (~50% chance over the storm duration) instead of instantly on first tick

### Fixed
- Rarity borders and backgrounds now correctly display on other players' profile gardens (#30)

### Added
- **Flower mutations** — bloomed flowers can now carry a mutation that changes their appearance and multiplies their sell value
- **8 mutation types** — Giant (8% flat chance on bloom), Wet (Rain), Scorched (Heatwave), Frosted (Cold Front), Stellar (Star Shower), Prismatic (Prismatic Skies), Gilded (Golden Hour), Moonlit (Moonlit Night)
- Mutation badge displayed on flowers in the inventory, gift inbox, and garden tooltip
- Mutations discovered via gifts or harvests are registered in the Floral Codex

### Changed
- Weather mutations only roll on fully bloomed flowers — seeds and sprouts are unaffected

### Fixed
- Rarity glow border on mutated flowers in the inventory was being replaced by the mutation colour — both now display together (#22)
- Flowers received as gifts now appear in the Botany Lab and Floral Codex (#20, #21)
- localStorage exploit: local saves with a `lastSaved` timestamp more than 30 s in the future are now rejected in favour of the authoritative cloud save (#26, #27)
